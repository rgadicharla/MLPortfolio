Vehicle Price Drivers Summary Report

The analysis of vehicle sales data across all states identified the most consistent features influencing resale price. These insights help adjust inventory choices to maximize the profit margin and meet customer demand.
This analysis focused on grouping by states to identify what drove the sales prices in individual states. 

* Key Findings

- Odometer (50 states)  
  Mileage is the most universal driver of price. Lower‑mileage vehicles consistently command higher resale values.  

- Year (49 states)  
  Model year is nearly as influential. Newer vehicles retain more value and sell faster, making them critical for inventory planning.  

- Type (27 states)  
  Body style (SUV, sedan, truck, etc.) plays a major role in pricing. SUVs and trucks often outperform sedans in resale value, especially in certain regions.  

- Manufacturer (12 states)  
  Brand reputation matters in specific markets. Popular manufacturers (e.g., Toyota, Ford, Honda) show stronger price resilience. 
- Condition (8 states)  
  Vehicle condition impacts price, though less consistently than mileage or year. 


* Implications for Inventory Strategy

- Prioritize low‑mileage, newer vehicles: These are universally valued and will maximize resale margins.  
- Balance body types by demand: SUVs and trucks should be emphasized in states where they dominate top features.  
- Leverage brand strength: Stock more vehicles from manufacturers with proven resale performance in your target markets.  
- Maintain quality standards: Invest in reconditioning to elevate vehicle condition, ensuring consistent customer perception.  



* Recommended Actions

1. Procurement: Focus sourcing on newer, low‑mileage vehicles, especially SUVs and trucks.  
2. Regional tailoring: Adjust inventory mix by state — e.g., more trucks in Texas, more sedans in urban Northeast markets.  
3. Marketing: Highlight mileage and year prominently in listings, as these are the strongest selling points.  
4. Quality control: Ensure vehicles meet “good” or better condition to support pricing power.  


* Conclusion
By focusing on mileage, year, type, manufacturer, and condition, the inventory strategy can align more closely with the features that drive customer value. This ensures better pricing accuracy, faster turnover, and stronger margins across regions. Please refer to the chart to identify the top performers in each state individually.
